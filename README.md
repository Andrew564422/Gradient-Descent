# Gradient-Descrnt
***
* This repo contain different types of Gradient Descent (Batch, Stocastics, Mini-batch) <br>
* In this notebook, I made my own function implementation for different types of gradient descent <br> 
* I made single and multi variables implementation for batch gradient descent <br>
* But with mini batch and stochastic mad single variable only, and it is easy to generalize it to multi variable <br>
* With each implementation, I used different parameters to display different results
* Also made function to plot some figures to see what happend for losses and see best fit line
